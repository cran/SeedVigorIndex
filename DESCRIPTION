Description: Seed vigor is defined as the sum total of those properties of the seed which determine the level of activity and performance of the seed or seed lot during germination and seedling emergence.  Testing for vigor becomes more important for carryover seeds, especially if seeds were stored under unknown conditions or under unfavorable storage conditions. Seed vigor testing is also used as indicator of the storage potential of a seed lot and in ranking various seed lots with different qualities. The vigour index is calculated using the equation given by (Ling et al. 2014) <doi:10.1038/srep05859>.
